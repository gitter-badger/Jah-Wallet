# What is all about?
The fundamental idea that lives behind Jah is to implement wallet that will hide current complexity within [existing crypto protocols and networks](https://github.com/cyberFund/cyberDigest) and will allow people just create, keep and transfer any type of assets as their true digital property like [Coinprism](https://www.coinprism.com).

But the purpose of Jah is not only in allowing people to use digital assets, but to give creative power to developers to build apps that disrupts existing apps and make monetisation of any app very simple.

In real world Jah is just another humble bitcoin wallet powered by [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org).

But Jah tends to go a little bit further and give beautiful cryptocurrency community more powerfull way for monetize their apps while instantly grant their users disruptive functions of bitcoin-like technologies.

## Technology Concept
- [Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification) protocol makes the *heart* of Jah beats and makes genius invention happens.
- [Open Assets](https://github.com/OpenAssets/open-assets-protocol/blob/master/specification.mediawiki), Next, Counterparty, BitsharesX, protocols form Jah *mind* and burns everybody's brains with kind new feeling about their digital property.
- Jah choose *body* on top of [Web Components](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro) using [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) to provide awesome compatibility with future web.
- [Digital Data Layer](http://www.w3.org/2013/12/ceddl-201312.pdf) gives Jah *power* to move and automagicaly create unexplored possibilities for a marketers.
- [BIP 32](), [BIP 38](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0038), [BIP 39] prove its importance and they like the pain in the ass untill it will be implemented in Bitcoin Protocol.

## Evolving
- Jah instantly realize his closeness to science, nature and code so he decide to live in Github for a while.
- Jah feels that educational approach is Private Key for people understanding of what is all about.
- Jah hopes that every inspired creature will bring the code to make him live.
